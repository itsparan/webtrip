A CI/CD pipeline consists of the following steps:

Source control: The code is stored in a source control repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.
Build: The code is built into a deployable artifact, such as a Docker image or a JAR file.
Test: The artifact is tested to ensure that it works as expected.
